# Video File To Blinking Data Pipeline

*THINGS TO INCLUDE*
* Explaining the additional code that automates the analysis of multiple videos
* Explain the chosen naming conventions
* Talk about the "threshold dilemma" and why I made the decision that I did
* Explain the pre-processing steps needed for the video files

*Questions*
* Again, how objective do I need to be when justifying my decisions? How much gut feeling/time pressure is allowed to factor in?
