# Video File To Blinking Data Pipeline

*THINGS TO INCLUDE*
* Explaining the additional code that automates the analysis of multiple videos
* Explain the chosen naming conventions
* Talk about the "threshold dilemma" and why I made the decision that I did
* Explain the pre-processing steps needed for the video files (attaching)

*TODO*
* AGAIN TRY TO FIND A METRIC FOR THE VARIOUS THRESHOLD CALCULATION METHODS
    * SHOW EXAMPLES AND PROS/CONS FOR EACH METHOD TO MOTIVATE FINAL CHOICE OBJECTIVELY ==> THIS IS THE FINAL CONCLUSION OF THIS PART
* USE SCALING ISSUE IDENTIFICATION TO JUSTIFY REDOING THE TEST WITH MANUALLY COUNTED 15 MINUTE VIDEOS
* SEE IF VENN DIAGRAM IS STILL SIMILAR
    * BUT AGAIN TRY TO FIND A DIFFERENT METRIC THAT IS MORE INTUITIVE ALSO

*Questions*
* Again, how objective do I need to be when justifying my decisions? How much gut feeling/time pressure is allowed to factor in?
