# Feasibility Of Using Automated Blink Detection

*THINGS TO INCLUDE*
* Describe process of choosing and analyzing video samples manually & automatically
* Give pros and cons for both
* Include the final comparison of the two and why I thought it was worth choosing the automatic method
* Add the data presentation given (plus make improvements based on the questions asked during that meeting)

*QUESTIONS*
* How formal/objective should I be here? Can I say "it would take too long" or should I go back and time how long it takes to manually analyze the videos?
