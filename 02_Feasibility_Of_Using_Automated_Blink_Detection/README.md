# Feasibility Of Using Automated Blink Detection

*THINGS TO INCLUDE*
* Describe process of choosing and analyzing video samples manually & automatically
* Give pros and cons for both
* Include the final comparison of the two and why I thought it was worth choosing the automatic method
* Add the data presentation given (plus make improvements based on the questions asked during that meeting)

*TODO*
* EXPERIMENT WITH PREPROCESSING THE VIDEOS AGAIN AND THEN DO THE COMPARISON TWICE (OR MORE) TO SEE IF UNEDITED OR NOT IS BETTER AS STEP1(/STEP2)
    * LOOK AT VENN DIAGRAMS AGAIN AND PROPORTIONALITY PER SUBJECT
* MERGE THIS WITH STEP 1

*QUESTIONS*
* How formal/objective should I be here? Can I say "it would take too long" or should I go back and time how long it takes to manually analyze the videos?
